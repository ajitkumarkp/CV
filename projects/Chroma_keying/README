## Chroma Keying ##
# This project implements an algorithm for green screen matting or chroma keying from scratch. 

## Description ##

# The input to the algorithm will be a video with a subject in front of a green screen. 
# 1. the asteroid spinning with a green screen background 
# 2. Orange sky image

# The output is another video where the green background is replaced with the orange sky background. 
# There is also a simple UI using HighGUI to control/select the following:
# 1. Color Patch Selector : Click on the green area to select the color
# 2. Tolerance slider : This slider controls how different the color can be from the mean of colors sampled in the previous step to be included in the green background.
# 3. Blurring/Softness slider : This slider will control the softness of the foreground mask at the edges.
